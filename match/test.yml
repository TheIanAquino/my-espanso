              Hi there, {{name}}!

              I'm Ian -- nice to meet you. I have a list of things that I'm sure you'd appreciate to check out first, so you could get to know me better:

              - Some basic information about me: 
                https://theianaquino.github.io/public-journal/_READ-ME-FIRST#basic-information

              - My Interests and Skills: 
                https://theianaquino.github.io/public-journal/_READ-ME-FIRST#interests--skills

              - My Values Sheet: 
                https://theianaquino.github.io/public-journal/00_my-values-sheet

              Out of the three, I would highly recommend checking out my Values Sheet, as I regard that as one of the main things that people should be aware of, once they start getting to know me.

              Feel free to ask me questions after you check those resources out, should you have any!

              Cheers,
              Ian
